This is my neural network for dog identification, nn.ipynb is for training and inference.ipynb is for predictions / inference. I am making this neural network for my upcoming DogDex (Name WIP) project which I am doing for Hackclub Flavourtown and possibly for the STAV Science Talent Search.

#### Extra
P.S. for anyone who bothered to read this Wakatime counts the neural network training as coding so I rack up lots of hours from training new models. I of course, don't abuse this and just train new models 24/7 but there's nothing I can do if it is counting the times when I do need to train networks.
